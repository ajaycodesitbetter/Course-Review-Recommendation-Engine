## Backend API Endpoints Used

Your backend provides these endpoints that the frontend now uses:

- `GET /trending?limit=12` - Trending courses
- `GET /top-rated?limit=12` - Top rated courses  
- `GET /search?query=...&limit=12` - Search courses
- `GET /recommendations?course_id=...&limit=10` - Similar courses
- `POST /recommendations/user` - Personalized recommendations
- `GET /course/{id}` - Course details (fallback)

## Testing Results

✅ **Local Testing Successful**:

## Deployment Status
